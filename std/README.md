# The Inko standard library

Inko's standard library is a collection of modules available to every
application. Some types and methods provided by the standard library are
available by default without the need for an explicit `import` (e.g. the `Array`
and `Map` types), while others require an explicit `import` (e.g.
`std.set.Set`).

For more information, refer to the [Inko
manual](https://docs.inko-lang.org/manual/latest/).
